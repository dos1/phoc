phoc (0.1.4) amber; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * build: drop rootston=false from wlroots submodule build
    rootston is no longer part of wlroots so the option causes
    a warning during build.
  * view: Add helper to move windows between outputs
  * keybindings: allow to move windows to left/right output
  * Update submodule.
    This pulls in the gbm fix.
  * Add doap file.
    This helps to identify project maintainers and contact points.
  * d/control: Add Sebastian to uploaders
  * xdg_shell_v6: Implement get_geometry.
    As long as these are around there's no reason why v6 should
    be worse than stable
  * Introduce view_is_maximized.
    This will allow us to introduce a tiled state as well.
  * view: Simple left right tilig.
    This uses the 'maximized' state to get rid of GTK's drop
    shadows until we have fixed
    https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/2171
  * view: Differentiate between tiled and normal on unmaximize
  * keybindings: bind left and right tiling
  * d/control: Depend on gsettings schemas.
    Not having them makes us not start

  * Update wlroots submodule.
    Forward to 9fb251c33fc404f106f0b4e3b6839de9d4753a4c for virtual
    keyboard keycode 0 fix.

  * render: set surface as sampled for presentation.
    This is necessary after [1].
    [1]: https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/pull/1798
  * Fix presentation feedback when scanning out fullscreen views.
