  * cursor: g_assert on NULL cursor.
    Don't try to go on without a cursor (which can only happen when calloc
    fails). wlroots also only returns NULL in case of memory problems. This
    allows to remove the NULL checks elsewhere
  * tests/phosh: Use GrabStatus.
    The current accelerator tests try to encode two boolean values
    into two variables making it a bit hard to read. Use a single
    enum instead.
  * tests/phosh: Make tested keybindins more obvious.
    Currently one needs to look up what's tested in an array but each most
    of the keys are only used a single time. So drop that array and use a
    define for the single key that is used multiple times so it's clear we
    just add an accelerator.
  * tests/phosh: Set and check both test vars.
    Always set and check both keybinding results. This tests that
    we don't invoke the wrong callback accidentally.
  * phosh: Don't crash when we failed to parse the accelerator.
    Passing an invalid keybinding otherwise doesn't end well.
  * phosh: Allow to bind misc keys.
    Until we allow to bind all keys let's allow for these as well since
    this block includes e.g. PrintScreen for screenshots.

phoc (0.4.4) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * desktop: Refresh all views when auto-maximize changes.
    So far this only affected new views but when e.g. unplugging an
    external (switching to 'phone' mode) we want running apps to
    behave.
  * phosh: Drop rotate-display.
    The rotate_display served us well but it's too simplistic (no events,
    degrees instead of transforms, ...). Since phosh now uses
    wlr-output-management for bid to use this part of the private protocol.
  * d/control: Add breaks for older phosh.

phoc (0.1.8) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * d/control: Bump wlroots dependency.
    Bumped to 0.10.0 since this is sufficient to build and run
    although 0.10.1 is preferred.
  * build: Bump project version.
    This makes it match the version in the changelog
  * PhocServer: Move startup command from config.
    No need to tuck away the command we run in config, it's only
    configurable via the command line.
  * main: Use automtic cleanup for mainloop
  * main: Use automatic cleanup for the server
  * server: Get hold of the main loop.
    This allows the server to exit cleanly
  * server: Exit when session exits.
    This allows e.g. a systemd unit to properly restart compositor
    and shell in case of session crash. It also allows to support
    logout under display managers like GDM.
    Prerequisite for phosh#117 since we also need to updte gnome-session
    for this.
  * Remove output mapping for devices and cursors.
    For cursors we don't have a real use and for devices we're going
    to make this default properly.
  * output: Add helper to detect built-in panels.
    This is similar to what phosh does.
  * roots_seat_configure_cursor: Pass roots_output.
    This avoids going back and forth between roots_ and wlr_output;
  * seat: Map touch screens to build in displays by default.
    This is currently hard coded and can not be changed
  * seat: Map tablet devices as well
  * seat: Fix wrong struct type.
    Touch is not a pointer but 'struct roots_touch'
  * server: Fix odd indentation
  * server: Introduce debug flags.
    This keeps the number of arguments and variables under control.
  * Parse debug flags from environment.
    This makes things more consistent with other glib applications
    and allows us to use expressive comma separated lists instead
    of command line flags.
  * Use PHOC_SERVER_DEBUG_DAMAGE_TRACKING.
    This avoids passing boolean flags around
  * Use PHOC_SERVER_DEBUG_TOUCH_POINTS.
    This avoids passing boolean flags around
  * server: Introduce no-quit debug flag.
    This allow to not quit the session which is useful for e.g.
    phosh development where one wants to replace the running shell
    without the compositor caring.
  * README: Document PHOC_DEBUG
  * gitlab-ci: Enable coverage information
  * README: add coverage information.
    This makes current coverage very visible
  * README: fix cut'n'paste error
  * d/copyright: Use correct licenses.
    As per de56ea6b1e3cfa41981fd4dd349b0eef852aee23 we default to GPL-3+
    (same as phosh). That's also consistent with the COPYING file.
    We keep `src/*` separate to respect the copyright notices brought
    over from rootston and keep the protocols under their initial
    licenses.
  * server: Fix method name.
    We use it as finalize() but called it dispose().
  * Don't destroy xwayland in phoc_server.
    We create it in phoc_desktop so it should be destroyed there as well.
    This also fixes a crash on server shutdown when the desktop wasn't even
    created.
  * server: Track multiple setup.
    We currently track whether the singleton was inited which
    is broken since we have a weak ref. Rather make sure we
    don't setup the instance multiple times.
  * server: Fix error output.
    We only create the backend, it's started later on in _setup().
  * tests: Add simple test that runs a main loop
  * server: Remove wayland source on shutdown
  * server: Unset envvars on shutdown.
    It's always better to clean up but this also allows to run
    two tests using the wayland backend in the same process.
  * tests: Properly finalize the server.
    So far we used the same server instance in all the tests
    which fails when we allow to run init just once.
  * tests: Pass a phoc.ini.
    This one disables Xwayland since that causes trouble when
    restarting it multiple times and we currently don't need it.
  * server: Use self conistently.
    We call the first method argument self elsewhere so this consistently in
    all methods.
  * server: Move wl_display_destroy_clients() to dispose.
    This allows clients to shut down properly, we'll call into
    already freed objects like input.
    Note that wl_display_destroy() was never run since the wl_display was
    already NULL when and we were using g_clear_pointer().
  * server: Call wlr_backend_destroy() in dispose.
    This allows wlroots to clean up and we can call wl_display_destroy ()
    in finalize.
  * input: Guard against NULL input.
    This one pops up often when wlroots or the server cleans
    up and this makes it obvious at a glance what's wrong.
    We can't use PHOC_IS_INPUT yet since it's not a gobject yet.
  * README: document how to run the tests.
    This allows us to mention xvfb-run which is needed for screenshot
    comparison tests.
  * protocols: Generate client protocols.
    These are needed by the tests
  * protocols: Add wlr-screencopy-manager
  * tests: Add testlib.
    This allows to run a wayland client against the compositor
    and to take and compare screenshot of the output. (Closes: #40)
  * tests: Add simple client test.
    This validates that clients can connect and find their globals
    and also demos the library usage.
  * tests: Add layer shell test.
    Initial tests to test layer-shell layout (since we had several
    surprises there). This also demos the screenhost machinery.
    For tests to succeed they need to run under e.g. xfvb since
    the mouse cursor might get placed differently otherwise.
  * gitlab-ci: Don't reset xvfb between test runs.
    This should avoid connection failures with multiple tests. We
    do the same with libhandy.
  * seat: Be consistent with whitespace.
    Let's not mix tab and spaces in the same function.
  * seat: Don't notify activity on `set_cursor`
    Rather notify on tool set_cursor activity where it is important.
    This avoids setting activity events on `set_cursor` when nothing
    really changed.
    To see what thi fixes blank the screen using `lock sreen` in phosh
    with https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/phosh/-/merge_requests/300
    applied and see it wake up right away.
  * desktop: Add getter/setter for maximization
  * tests: testlib: Add server prepare hook.
    This allows to tweak the compositor configuration before
    launching the client
  * tests: Wire up xdg_wm_base.
    This will be used in followup commits for xdg-shell testing
  * tests: Add initial xdg-shell tests
  * output: Enable new outputs by default.
    This was done by wlroots but isn't in 'recent' versions (which gives
    the compositor more room). (Closes: #130)
  * phosh: Drop xdg-switcher interface.
    Instead of requiring a phosh/phoc lockstep upgrade post an error if a
    client wants to bind the protcol. This keeps the code we need carry
    minimal but we can still be backward compatible (this is not breaking
    clients that don't use that part of the protocol).
  * input: Make_device_type() public
    public. While at that rename to phoc_get_device_type ()
  * Rename virtual_keyboard.[ch] to virtual_[ch]
    We handle virtual pointer there as well.
  * virtual: Use g_return_if_fail () instead of wlr_log ()
    We can turn this into a type check later on and it makes
    sure log domains work correctly.
